# what2play
## Choose | Prompt | Play
### Overview 
- This project aims to address the issue of millennials and Generation Z having difficulty selecting a playlist or music to listen to while engaging in an activity. 
- Music is generally associated with action and productivity. 
- It takes some effort to find the ideal music to assist encourage you to work.
- Â We must listen to music and choose whether or not it is appropriate. This is intended to address the issue.
- All this is doene via the *spotify API*
** Note that this does not create new playlists for you but rather displays the best or whatever fits.
### Process flow 
- The user is prompted to login on entry point of the app.
- The home page ,so far will display your profile and an array of activities or moods to choose from.
- This then generates a page or an array | lists of playlists 
- the user will then choose what2play --- hehehe.
- Playback initiated.
### Existing solutions.
Of course, there are numerous music players. However, aspects of the process that take time as we browse through what is ideal for us are eliminated.
### Features

## Local Installation & Set Up

1. Register a Spotify App in your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and add `http://localhost:8888/callback` as a Redirect URI in the app settings

2. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project based on `.env.example` and add your unique `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the Spotify dashboard

3. Ensure [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed globally

4. Install the correct version of Node

    ```shell
    nvm install
    ```

5. Install dependencies

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

6. Run the React app on <http://localhost:3000> and the Node server on <http://localhost:8888>

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
    

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
